# Coverslip-level analysis

Calculation of statistical differences using coverslip-level data, `histData.mat`. The MATLAB program `statDiff_cnComb_4groups_30b40mp_coverslipL.m` can be run locally. If needed, it can also be run in a cluster using the shell script `runStatDiff4groupsCSL.sh` and the following command (conservative time estimate provided): 
```
sbatch --time=01:00:00 runStatDiff4groupsCSL.sh
```
