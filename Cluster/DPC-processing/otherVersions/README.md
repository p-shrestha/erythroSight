# Other versions for processing DPC images

Here, other versions of running the DPC processing, e.g. `runDPCCanada2.sh`, are provided. Additionally, `export_DPC_XY_Multiple_CC_Scratch.py` includes a version of DPC processing without having the unique ID or UID as an input argument, but rather as part of the code.
