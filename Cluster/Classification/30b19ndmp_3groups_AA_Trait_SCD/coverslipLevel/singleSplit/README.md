# Classification using a single random split

The data is split randomly into 80:20 training:testing. The MATLAB program `carpenter30b19ndmp3groups_AA_Trait_SCD_CoverslipL_singleSplit.m` creates the necessary tables required for training/testing using the Classification Learner App in MATLAB. This program was run locally in a Windows machine and not in the cluster.
