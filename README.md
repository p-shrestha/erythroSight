# erythroSight
Includes programs for processing and analyzing images from [Octopi microscope](https://doi.org/10.1101/684423) with red blood cells for characterization and detection of sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia

Based on where the code is implemented, the following categories are available: 
- Local: For implementation in a local machine
- Cluster: For implementation in cluster, such as Compute Canada ([Digital Research Alliance of Canada](https://ccdb.alliancecan.ca/)) 

The dataset of all the images (raw/processed) and processed data (segmentation results, morphological characterization, and plots) are available in an open access database:
